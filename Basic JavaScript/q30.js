/*
Sometimes you will need to build a string. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

Example:

const ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
const ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
ourStr would have a value of the string Hello, our name is freeCodeCamp, how are you?.

Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings My name is and and I am well!*/

// Example
const ourName = "Free Code Camp";
const ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
const myName = 'Emanuel';
const myStr = 'My name is ' + myName + ' and I am swell!';
